# General

## What is folD?
Personal finance manager, that helps you understand your current financial situation. folD includes features such as adding your expenses & incomes, or viewing them in a chart!

## The idea
I wanted to create something that would actually help me, and I alway found banking apps kinda complicated + I wasn't able to see expenses from multiple account in one graph.

# Desing

## Logo
Picture I use as a logo was not made by me, it is a canva template which I liked a lot and you can find the creator [here](https://www.canva.com/p/cincin-emas/).

## Colors
As you might noticed, the colors are matching the logo. I just took the color codes from the logo and created a gradient that is displayed in the background. Later on, I picked color codes from the gradient, and added them to the script that is creating the graph.

# Technical documentation

## Technologies
Application is built using Python framework Django, which covers the whole backend side.
On the other side, for front end, I decided to use classic HTML & CSS. Besides these two, I also used free open-source JavaScript library called Charts.js, which covers the big chart on the dashboard.
