# What is folD?
Personal finance manager, that helps you understand your current financial situation. folD includes features such as adding your expenses & incomes, or viewing them in a chart!

# The idea
I wanted to create something that would actually help me, and I alway found banking apps kinda complicated + I wasn't able to see expenses from multiple account in one graph.
